This project is a small Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) demo.

It uses FastAPI and Gemini to answer questions based only on the text documents placed in the data folder.

The system loads .txt and .md files, chunks them, embeds them, and retrieves the most similar chunks for each user question.
